Pittsburgh, PA 15213","Lulu's has two things going for it: it's cheap, and it's close to Carnegie Mellon's campus. Besides that, the service isn't great, they have forgotten my food, and the food isn't that great. I keep going back because up until recently, there wasn't any other choice that close to campus for quick Asian food. 

The items are hit or miss, and lackluster. Good luck. I'm not saying it's horrible, it's just uninspired, boring, and not that flavorful.","2006-02-19",2

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","Sorry, guy, everyone I know loves this place. Sure there are a few things I didn't like, but most are tasty, fresh and not at all as greasy or too saucy like lots of Chinese takeout. Highlights include the Lard Nar Pork, Hong Kong Chow Fun Beef, almost any noodle bowl, the Teriyaki Chicken Salad. And the gyoza appetizer, so yummy! As a group, me and my coworkers like to hit it once a month. For those who might peruse the menu, Yum Wok is the more mainstream Chinese menu, LuLu's Noodles being a collection of different Asian noodle dishes.

update - When I wrote this there was only maybe one other review. I hear you guys. Yeah, don't get the stuff that's not Chinese. You are NOT going to get good or authentic pad thai, or teriyaki chicken, or udon.  You will usually get tasty, not overly greasy, Americanized Chinese food. Although the gyoza is very, very good.","2006-09-05",5

The shrimp and veggies were fresh, but the flavors didn't meld the way they should. Sauce was a little too gelatinous, and there was too much of it. Service was unfriendly and perfunctory. However, the green tea was really good--and really, really green. I'm with Matt L. on this one.","2007-03-11",2

Their Thai iced tea and bubble teas are both good.  The spring rolls come with delicious sauce on the side, and all of the vegetarian entrees are appealing.

I don't often eat at the restaurant itself, I am more a order-from-wheeldeliver.com or pick-up person.  Service isn't great, which is probably why I avoid eating in-house.

OK, that's not exactly true.  BUT I am from Pittsburgh.  I went to college at Carnegie Mellon.  I ate here a LOT in college and whenever I go home to visit I insist we eat here - multiple times.  I have dragged my husband and son here up to 3 times in a week-long visit.

We still have a few college friends in the area so there is still the chance to meet at LuLu's and really make it feel like old times.  I love the food but I will admit part of the appeal is that chance to relieve one's prime...  who knows.

I love their pho (either with chicken or veggies/tofu) and their thai curry chicken (either with chicken or tofu).  They have no problem making either one without onions - good for me because I am picky.

Love their fried red bean won tons.

Love their bubble drinks which I think are fairly new - they didn't have those when i was in college.  

Love their slightly engrishy menu - I think it's the hot and sour soup where they claim ""And wow!  is it good?""

Love the goofy pictures on the walls of the kids and noodles - wonder what those kids are up to now?  So weird to go there and know they're getting old just like the rest of us but there they are, young and covered in noodles.

Good times, good food.  Yeah the service can suck - we call it the LuLu's experience to note how the food never all comes out at one time so one person will be finishing as another is just getting their food - and if you ask for water to drink, it tastes like it came out of the hose.  But I love LuLus and no trip to Pittsburgh would be complete without at least one meal there.","2007-12-29",5

If you like singapore rice noodles (with the curry and chicken and pork), I would compare it with Orient Express. 
Oh, and they own the Asiana in CMU, which is fine if you are in a hurry and can't leave campus but generally not so great. The kim chi is subpar. I like the canned grass jelly and guava juice though...

Whatever you do, don't get the Pho, it doesn't taste like pho, it doesn't even taste good. 

They have bubble tea. Some people don't like Taro chunks in theirs. I don't mind them but I also prefer Orient Express's Taro tea anyway.

I had one of the worst meals in Pittsburgh at Lulu's. 

If you must persist in your folly by continuing to go to Lulu's, DO NOT order the Thai Beef Basil. It was disgusting. They used beef that had been clearly tenderized in some sort of acid(probably pineapple juice). It also had canned tomatoes, and no basil. The kicker was that the sauce they cooked it in was, without a doubt, KETCHUP.  OH MY GAWD! And supposedly Asians actually work at and own this restaurant!?!?

So you don't have to share a dish ever.  The Dr. Foo's Special is a really awesome popular dish, I get it about every time I go.  You have to mix in the Dr. Foo's Special sauce.  The Pad Thai and the Spicy Sechewan are good dishes too.  Their appetizers are good and cheap too. 
 I would recommend going here over Oriental Express every day unless you are in a hurry.  Lulu's service can be horrible sometimes.  Once the waitress didn't realize she was our waitress and left us sitting there for 15 minutes.
 Lulu's does have the best bubble tea in Pittsburgh though.  I like Classic the most.  But I figured out the smoothies are the best bang for your buck because they aren't 50% ice like the bubble teas sometimes are.

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","Sunday lunch at Lulu's - after working in Oakland for two years and eating there only during weekdays at lunch, who knew that Lulu's actually has sit-down service during the daytime? I didn't, that's for sure, so I was surprised to see a bit of a line forming near the entrance at 1:30 on a Sunday.

No problem, as we were seated within a few minutes of our arrival.

Now you don't go to Lulu's for good service. You don't go to Lulu's for the dining ""experience"" that other restaurants offer. You probably don't go expecting an ""authentic"" menu. You go for tasty food, served quickly and hot. 

Spicy basil noodles with chicken, on this visit, hit the spot just as they have on every other visit I've made. In fact, I love it so much that I hate to order anything else from the menu because I'm afraid to miss out on the vermicelli noodles steaming with carrots, snow peas, red and green peppers, etc. The sauce is sweet and salty, and could be spicier but I'm afraid to doctor up the plate with the red pepper sauce they have on each table for fear of ruining the dish.

The crowd is nice on a Sunday, relaxed but not lethargic. Our server was polite, took our orders quickly, and stopped once during our meal to make sure everything was ok. 

A word about takeout - I've only ordered it once from Lulu's and it was a remarkable disappointment. The food took forever to come out (30 minutes or so) and the balance of noodles to sauce to veggies and chicken was off because it was prepared in the to-go container rather than on a plate. I learned my lesson and now I'll only dine in.","2008-08-24",4

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","I had lunch at Lulu's today after St. Paul's Easter mass, only as a last resort because Crepes Parisiennes and Eat Unique were both closed for the day.  I had two bad experiences at Lulu's before, but that was about a year ago, and I was hungry.  The memories of past horrible food had faded gently in my mind, and I was feeling forgiving.  

Big mistake.

I ordered the BBQ pork noodle bowl, and Bob the Boyfriend ordered ramen.  The food came out fast enough, so no complaints there.  But from the first bite, it was clear that things had gone horribly awry.  The pork on top of the bowl looked and tasted like something a dog would gnaw on, tough, dry, and very salty.  Underneath, my noodles were completely unseasoned, just rice vermicelli with nothing else to speak of.  

As for the boyfriend, Bob's ramen was technically ramen, I guess, since the noodles were ramen noodles.  But instead of a savory beef or pork broth, his noodles were backstroking in miso.  While this is weird and cheap-ass of them, I can't complain, since the broth was clearly described as 'miso' on the menu.  But the real problem was the miso broth itself.  The amount of miso in it made my tongue curl.  It was so salty it was almost inedible.

When the waitress asked me if everything was OK, I told her plainly about the dry pork and the bland noodles, and she said ""Yup, that's the way it comes.""  I was stunned and didn't know what to say, so I asked her to suggest something else.  She recommended the Singapore rice noodles.  

The Singapore noodles came out after a short wait, and the noodle bowl mercifully disappeared.  But then the new noodles were so heavily spiced that they were (again) almost inedible.  Certainly not bland this time, though!  I have to wonder if they were messing with me.  Finally, we asked for to go boxes and high tailed it out of there.  It was a depressing, bad experience.

Other notes: The atmosphere is horrid (loud music, completely crowded), and the waitstaff is aloof, almost bitchy.

I'm aware that this review has turned into a bit of a rant.  The fact is, as I mentioned earlier, I've had two bad experiences there before.  I'll spare you the details.  I am hoping this review will serve as a reminder to myself in the future: Erin, it doesn't matter how hungry you are or how much people try to talk you into Lulu's.  Don't cave.

If you're in Oakland and in the mood for some greasy noodles (sometimes I actually am), Lulu's can be all right.  The menu is pretty clear on which dishes can be made vegetarian, which I appreciated.  I don't really expect authenticity with a Pan-Asian place, so I'd go with dishes that are less ""traditional,"" like the chow fun or the pan-fried noodles.  Big portions, pretty fast.

Don't think I need to mention the service here--other people have covered that.  It'd be nice, though, if when you ordered the taro bubble tea (non-smoothie), that they'd warn you that the drink came with taro bits.

It's noisy and filled with the 20-somethings you would expect to find in a college town, but there were indeed enough of those of us who are, let's say -- not-a-20-something -- to feel comfortable, 

Menu has lots of choices that are familiar asian fare, and they are apparently known for their noodle dishes.  Hubby and I decided on a pork and chicken entree respectively, which were both surprisingly good, considering how inexpensive they were.  You also get more than enough food to satisfy a ravinous appetite, which we both had.  The ""kids"" had the General Tso chicken and a terriyake chicken dish which they proclaimed were deelish!

LuLu's also had a nice selection of fruit smoothie style drinks, and they looked yummy.  Atmosphere is a litte frantic and the place is quite noisy, so it's not the place for a date, but if you are hungry, don't have a lot of dough and want something quick and tasty, LuLu's is a very good bet!","2009-11-09",3

Why this gets an extra star in my book: the bubble tea! Yummm. Not ""great"" bubble tea for boba connoisseurs out there, but I definitely got hooked. Over the summer, I had bubble tea here 2-5 times a week (yikes!) My favorite: mango ice with bubbles and no sugar. Request no sugar if you don't want to be overwhelmed by sweetness! It's really good as it is. They use fresh fruit and everything. The smoothies are a little too heavy IMHO because they mix in icecream, but the ices are so good, especially on a hot day. And the bubbles are so fun to chew on! Anyway, I was so happy to find this after trying the bubble tea at Orient Express, which is definitely inferior (& more expensive).","2009-11-22",3

If you want really good Pho, go to Tram's or Pho Mihn on Penn in Lawrenceville. For suburb sushi, try Chaya in Sq. Hill. And for good Korean, go to Sushi Kim's in the Strip.  In fact, I think any Asian place in Pittsburgh, would be better than going here.

We were seated promptly and provided with utensils and waters with our orders taken pretty quickly afterwards. We waited a while for the bill which took multiple promptings, but eventually were able to pay and leave. Although it was good for a quick meal, it was not a particularly satisfying dining experience.

Food: It was a skeptical moment to see such a wide variety of dishes at such low prices because quality becomes a factor (dishes between $6-$8). Skepticism was confirmed when the meals arrived. I ordered the Thai Curry Chicken and was not particularly impressed with the dish. It had the richness from the coconut milk, but it was a bit too sweet and the green beans tasted strange (as if old and past its freshness date). Onions were undercooked and chopped too largely that it conflicted with the texture of the dish. All in all, it was way off the mark. My brother ordered an udon dish with beef, but I was surprised to see that they added ground beef bits in it instead of slices  which to me communicated poor attention to details and choice of ingredients. 

Atmosphere: Very loud and chattery. Great for college students, large groups and families, but definitely not for a first date sort of deal or for lunch meetings (much too loud).

The prices aren't bad, but it really shows in the quality-- it's not one of those hole-in-the-wall, well-kept secret type place. There is a reason why the prices are cheap.

The waters came out promptly, but given the emptiness of the restaurant around 9PM, it took them a good 25 minutes to come out with our food that was essentially on par, if not worse than Orient Express.  Given that our choices may not have been Lulu's forte (besides my noodles, which should have been better given their restaurant name), the ma-po dish did not resemble ma-po at all.  the sauce was light brown, and everything in there was diced, and as my friend described, despite his request to have it ""extra spicy"", the dish did not even turn out to be any spicier than any other brown-sauced generic dishes, such as hunan chicken and szechuan chicken (i still don't know the difference between the two dishes to this day, at least by the way i've tasted it when cooked in the US).

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","It's ok for what it is, cheap and simple; $44 fed five (including three fruit-smooth/bubble-teas).

The rice noodles were undercooked (I didn't even think it was possible to undercook rice noodles, so I consider Lulu's a first).  The pork in my soup was overcooked and chewy.  The soup broth itself was incredibly bland before adding the readily available condiments such as soy sauce and chili sauce.  From what I could tell, Lulu's uses the same broth for all of their soups.  I wouldn't order their soup again.

The smoothie/bubble-tea was below average, contained real fruit but also contained the usual bubble-tea power mix; it was nothing special (I've had much better bubble-tea even without adding real fruit to the mix).  I'd drink it again in a pinch but would rather search elsewhere.

The service was terrible and for that alone I wouldn't return.  They weren't busy, there were employees standing around chatting and yet we waited almost fifteen minutes from the time our plates were collected before we had the bill.

I'm not sure how they compare to other Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh, but compared to Vancouver/Seattle/San Francisco... I'd say that the quality of food at Lulu's was about on par with the (relatively better) ramen noodles available at Asian grocery stores (the pre-packaged kind that is packaged moist, not the dehydrated crap available at Giant Eagle for twenty cents).  Compared to the average Asian restaurant that I'm used to, Lulu's was a major disappointment.","2011-01-29",2

First of all, their service is very awful. Every time I went there, I felt bad. All the servers in there are very unkind and never smile to their customers. If I want to ask something, I have to call them at least three times. When there is miscommunication or they couldn't understand what I said, they yelled at me. 

I had been there five years ago and due to the disappointing services and because we found dead fly in my friend's dish (and didn't apologize for that, when we complained about that nasty fly), I didn't go back. However, today I was starving and want to have Pat Thai so bad. I couldn't find anywhere else (Little Asia didn't accept credit card under $10). Therefore, I went there and I realized that there is nothing changed. To me, it is amazing that they're still running their business. In addition, food is not that impressive to endure their awful service. Until other people have different kind of Pat Thai, I didn't know that there is another option I can choose. I won't go back this restaurant never again.

To summery, very awful and unkind service and unimpressive food. Highly un-recommendable.","2011-02-15",1

The restaurant itself has a very casual and atmosphere, during lunch you order at the counter, as most of its patrons are Pitt/Carnegie Mellon students.  The restaurant is clean and spacious, and the service is wonderful. 

As it is a pan-Asian restaurant, don't expect  its food to very authentic to any particular region... I was very surprised as what was passed off as ""pho"" the first time I ate there.  It was certainly not anything like what you would get at an actual Vietnamese restaurant- the broth was bland and I think they used the wrong kind of noodles, and it didn't come with lime/lemon.  I should have known better. 

I did however LOVE their pad thai- which was also not very authentic- no tamarind paste etc.  It was good though because I was craving a carb fest.  So all in all, I'd give it three stars, they have their own interpretations of classic Asian dishes, and whether their interpretations of them are good or not is a crap shoot.","2011-02-22",3

I ordered a cup of the tom kha gai and the cold peanut noodles. The soup was tasteless. Usually spicy coconut soup is a) spicy, and 2) tastes like coconuts and lemongrass. This tasted like water. The peanut noodles were the correct consistency but the sauce resembled those cheap sauces in the microwave Thai meals you can buy at the supermarket - too much vinegar and mustard and not enough peanut and spice. I tried a bit of my friends' yellow curry and it was equally abhorrent. It tasted like they took a bottle of yellow mustard and threw in a few chili peppers and that was it.

Slow bad service, kind of dirty, stale environment.

I'm not a big fan of Chinese food to begin with so I have gone for the noodle Thai dishes more often. I don't even know why I kept going back besides my ex really liked General Tso's chicken and would grab takeout on his way home from work.

These were all bland boring, nothing special and never ordered again.
Sweet and sour chicken, shrimp-NO
Spicy Basil- all spice, could taste nothing else
Dr. Fu special-never get seafood here

Below were the items that were just OK. No complaints but no accolades either.
Cucumber salad- not so bad
Pad Thai-Frozen pad Thai is better
Singapore Rice noodles- flavorless chicken, sauce do-able

Uhm so horrible, the meat was that chewy gristle kind that you spit out into the napkin.
Sesame cold noodles-worms in peanut butter sauce
Lard Nar Bbq pork-gummy noodles like eating mush

I know a high school spanish teacher who is continually sniping at my enthusiasm for a few local Am-Mex dives because he's travelled to Mexico and knows what is ""authentic."" As far as I see it, if it is food you can taste and digest, it's ""authentic."" Plastic Grapes are not authentic, for example. Canned ravioli IS authentic.

Lulu's serves food of Asian origin, evolved to reflect the character of the proprietors and staff. It is from Pittsburgh, not Pyong Pinghu. And it's delicious. I couldn't give a cat's butt about faithfulness to it's heritage, not when I'm having little pleasure tremors as each bite of the szechuan bowl's peanutty cilantro goodness hits my tongue.

I've never had a bad dish here--no one in my family has. The soups are fantastic, especially the Tom Kha Kai. Even the mighty General Tso, Emperor of Inauthenticity, seems better here. My kid loves that stuff and--hells bells I'm not that proud--so do I. I always pinch a couple bites, and have noted that the chicken here is several steps above the skanky cuts most asian places use--no fat clots, no gristle and tendons, and that's saying something.

The frozen fruit drinks are fantastic. Mango are my favorites. The wife and kid #1 had pineapple and watermelon--pineapple tasted good, but the watermelon tasted just like an acutal watermelon, no ""wow"" explosion of taste.

last night, my girl and i tried to go to chinatown inn at about 8:55pm, assuming that it was open later than 9pm.  our bad - it closes at 9/9:30pm on wednesdays.  so, we scrapped that plan but still wanted some chinese food.  according to the yelp app, lulu's is open until 10pm - so, even though we were super-disappointed that we wouldn't be getting the amazing wonton soup at chinatown inn, we headed on over to oakland for some average noodles at average prices.

when we walked in at 9:10pm, we were immediately told that we could order takeout but couldn't eat in the restaurant.  okay, fine.  understood -- the staff has to cut the line somewhere...but 50 minutes early?  anyway, we begrudgingly ordered our food.  it came out quickly...actually, before many people's dishes who were actually allowed to eat in the restaurant.  

me and my doctor girlfriend?  we ate outside on a bench like hobos, keeping it real classy on craig street.  truly, we're not fancy people (remember: we go to ritter's at least once a week) -- so, we would have been fine with the whole situation had the food been good.  but, it was totally meh.  the chicken was rubbery.  the vegetables were flaccid (yes, flaccid).  and, the basil dish was spicy but not all that flavorful.

sorry, lulu's.  i used to be ambivalent about you, which works for me when we're eating late and kinda desperate.  but, weird ""service"" and un-passable food.  meh sums it up.  we won't be returning anytime soon.","2011-08-24",2

Now the bowl was only $7, which explains all the rice, but still, give me something, anything, to sauce my rice.

Now the good. I had a mango smoothy and some scallion pancakes. The mango smoothy was made from fresh mangos and definitely hit the spot. I'd get a big gulp of that next time. The scallion pancakes were the thinnest pancakes I've had. I've had medium thickness (my moms pancakes), thick pancakes (little dragons in Columbus, OH) and now thin. I really enjoyed the thin, easier to munch on and you taste the salt and oniony-ness more. The mango smoothie and scallion pancakes each earned the 2 stars for Lulu's. 

Maybe next time I'll just get mango smoothies and onion pancakes.","2011-10-17",2

However, the food here is terrible.  The menu is huge (that's not good) and everything is high unauthentic.  How can you advertise something like pho on the menu and have it taste and look nothing like the dish from which it bares its name???  Noodle soup does not equal hot water (no flavor) and noodle plus some questionable pieces of meat.  I've gotten sick from eating other ""Chinese"" dishes here.

I can see it being a pain during peak hours/times due to parking and limited seating, but I kind of think its worth the wait.

One - they put Sriracha sauce on every table.
Two - the Hot & Sour soup is nom
Three - they had crispy noodle dishes!!!

I had the LuLu Pan Fried Noodles with pork. While I didn't really care for their pork, the pan fried noodles were deelish. I had these once in another Chinese restaurant in Durham, but I could never remember the name of the dish or how to describe it. 

I don't think LuLu's stands out as a particularly awesome Chinese restaurant, but it certainly wasn't bad. If you're looking for something that isn't too authentic, I'd totally recommend this place.","2011-10-24",4

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","Was craving some Pho today. Being a Pho lover and having ate quite a bit of Pho in my lifetime, I must say the Pho was terrible. The Pho soup did not have the great beef flavor that is essential in every bowl of Pho. They did not put a lemon on the side and the beef in the bowl was already cooked and coated with some sort of slimy substance that made the meat more tender. My friend ordered the Szechuan noodle bowl and I had a bite of it and I must say it was much better. That being said, the Gyoza dumplings weren't that bad. 
As for service, there was none unfortunately... We had to wait for one of the staff members to clean the table next to us so we could get their attention for some more water and napkins. Very sub-par experience, but I will definitely return to give this place another shot. I will give it another review in the future.","2011-10-30",2

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","Since we have been attending a church in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, our family has really been enjoying exploring the nearby restaurants after worship.

This was my third visit to Lulu's.  My first visit, I went with the Pad Thai.  Same with the second visit.  Both times, the Pad Thai hit the spot and the price was definitely right.  

This last visit was on a Sunday afternoon and every single table was taken.  Even with the packed restaurant, our order was taken quickly and the food arrived not too long after.  The only service hiccup was in trying to get our check and some to go boxes for our leftovers.

For our family of 4, we ended up with:
- Fried Wontons (kinda different, kinda good with the red bean filling)
- Gyoza (never got one - the kids gobbled them up quickly)
- Yeung Chow Fried Rice (the entree I ordered - very tasty, not too greasy, a little heavy on the onions)
- Lard Nar BBQ Pork (my wife ordered this - I scored a bite and it was very good!)

I don't claim to be an expert on Asian cuisine (though I happen to be Asian myself).  Lulu's has a pretty expansive menu that covers quite a few different countries.  Considering the scope and the low prices on the menu, I don't expect perfection.  This is cheap eats place that does what it does well.

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","I went to Lulu's last week with a bunch of my friends for dinner. The one plus side is that this place is really, really cheap. Unfortunately, that's one of the only good things.
One of my friends told that the pad thai here is her absolute favorite. Well, since pad thai is one of my favorite foods of all time, I obviously had to try it. Firstly, it was really nothing like real pad thai. The sauce was dark brown (unlike pad thai sauce should be) and it was ridiculously sweet. If anything, it tasted more like pad see-ew. Also, I felt like I was nearly eating soup because my food was swimming in the sauce.
My girlfriend got bibimbap, which is another dish we absolutely love. Traditionally it's served in a ceramic pot that keeps it cooking when you get it, and the pot is filled with delicious rice and vegetables and topped with kimchi and sides of delicious sauces and more kimchi. We got a bowl that was literally just steamed white rice and vegetables and maybe two little pieces of mediocre kimchi. Absolutely no seasoning or flavor. The sauce the served it with was ok, but it didn't make up for the lack of taste the rest of the food had. 
Oh, I did get a mango milk tea for dessert, and it was pretty good. It had hardly any tapioca pearls in it...

I'm really not usually negative, but this place just didn't do it for me. I was really disappointed with my food.","2011-11-16",2

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","Lulu's has long become a staple to the neighboring college community in Oakland due to it's prime location on Craig St. and the price. 

However, the food is terrible. I've been to Lulu's on multiple occasions during my freshman days of college, simply because I was unfamiliar to the city and craved some Chinese food (or in this case anything ""asian""). As I got more familiar to Pittsburgh and found better options, I stopped dining at Lulu's completely. 
Until tonight after a moment of bad judgment, my boyfriend and I just wanted some normal fried rice, and would settle for mediocre Americanized ""asian"" food. 

I must say though, that their service is impeccably speedy. Too speedy. Within seconds of being seated and not even have had the chance to open our menus, our waitress asked us to order.  We ordered Scallion Pancakes, Java Fried Rice and Chicken Pad Thai, thinking that they can't possibly mess these very simple dishes up. How wrong we were. The fried rice was tasteless, (I'm usually complaining about food being too salty), and the pad thai was colorless, and swimming in liquid-y sauce (also smelled really bad). The Scallion Pancakes were literally store-bought tortillas with pureed scallions, so strange. 

I think what baffled me the most was that our waitress only finally reappeared to chuck our bill on the table, AS WE WERE STILL EATING. Nobody motioned for the bill, we still had food in our mouths and on the plates. Definitely made us feel very very rushed. Rude.

At least their beverages are okay.. most of their flavors are pretty artificial/powdery tasting, but whatever. Could use more bubbles though. 

If you have any respect for Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Korean, etc food, SKIP Lulu's. Please.","2012-04-23",1

We each ordered bubble milk tea.  My daughter had the red bean, and I had the almond.  She ended up liking mine better, since the red bean had a very floral taste to it which she was not used to.  I traded with her, even though the almond was definitely better.

For food, I had the Pad Thai, and she had Sesame Cold Noodles.  My dish was not aesthetically appealing, but it tasted OK.  It was not spicy at all, so I added quite a bit of Sriracha.  

Once again, my daughter wasn't very pleased with her selection, even though she said it was good.  She ended up eating half my plate instead, which  was fine by me, since the serving was large.  I did try her noodles, and they seemed OK.

The service was very good for us.  The server was concerned when my daughter didn't eat her food and offered to take it back, but we weren't that concerned about it.

I've had the Spicy Szechwan Noodle Bowl and the Spicy Basil Noodle Plate; both were fine. I've also tried the bubble tea which is a unique beverage to try. 

I've never had any problems with service here either.","2012-11-26",3

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","Alright, Lulu's has some good and some bad, unfortunately the bad stuck out a bit more. 

As usual, let's start with the bad news. 
The inside felt like the inside of a old undergrad cafeteria struggling to look modern and urban. The wall that we were placed against at our two-seater was filthy. The wall had brown stains spotted throughout; it looked like someone had a bad case of the runs while eating. The customers were your typical undergrad crowd looking for inexpensive eats. 
The waitress was soft spoken and knew little about the food and how it tasted or what was in it. There wasn't a whole lot of service here outside placing your order. It seemed like the people were frustrated to be working here. 
The food was mediocre with some good in it. We ordered the bim bim bop and the schezuan chicken noodles. The bim bim bop had overdone eggs and chicken which added an unpleasant bland rubbery texture. The schezuan chicken had something similar; bland flavor, rubbery, and not spicy. 

And the good... as it states in their title, Lulu's noodles. 
The noodles were good, not great, but enough to validate the restaurants title. The other good thing was the Sriracha sauce because without it there was absolutely no spice in this food. 

My girlfriend took me here since her last visit 2 years ago, and this maybe the next time I come back.","2013-01-13",2

Two thirds of the sitting at this place is in front of this particular door. Of course, everyone picks the side where the wind doesn't hit them, we are always the lucky ones who don't get to sit on that side. But we still go every time we're in the neighborhood (we keep our coats on the whole time) because this place is cheap AND good. 
I'm a little bummed out they use chicken broth for all their soups, I'll never get to try them, but their menu has enough choices to keep your palate entertained for a while. 
You can substitute, remove, add, and avoid any ingredient on any dish at this place. I dislike mushrooms so I always make sure I let my server know of it.

I also get the spicy schezuan (ask for light on the sauce) and I put sriracha in that too, but the chicken texture is weird. I also get it without the cilantro/parsely because I don't think the earthy taste of the herb is a good compliment to the schezuan.   Everything else I have tried there (because my friends got it) I did not like at all, such as: Pad Thai (worst Pad Thai I have ever had) and Dr. Fu's Special (it was kind of a tasteless white sauce)

The only thing I don't like about their fruit smoothies is that there's too much artificial flavoring in it.  I usually get strawberry/lychee or coconut/lychee - but these are things you can make on your own using fresh fruits and no funky food colorings.

The service is generally horrible.  I don't know a delicate, yet direct way to say it, but it's rare to get decent service.  It's slow and just... annoying.","2013-05-11",2

Some lowlights of our experience:

- Had to ask for napkins twice to no avail. Finally had to get up from the table, walk to the counter, and fetch some myself. Hello, where's my waitress?
- No cutlery came with our food, so had to ask for some. Chopsticks arrived 5 minutes after noodles did.
- Beef pho was absolutely inedible - lukewarm, flavorless, disgusting. I had to send it back to the kitchen. If you've ever had real pho, don't get it at Lulu's. Best case scenario you'll be sorely disappointed, more realistic is that you'll want to gag and be sick at the table.
- ""Pan-fried noodles"" are actually just an uncooked circular ramen brick covered in warm chicken and bok choy. I know Lulu's is catered towards the budget-conscious college crowd, but I could've saved more money and time just by buying a $0.25 packet of Maruchan from CVS and eating it straight from the bag.

So I came to get 2 mango smoothie bubble tea today. It was ridiculous that I ended up waiting 40 minutes just for 2 bubble for to go. And when I received my order, it was 2 strawberry--not 2 mango.

I proceeded to tell the lady that she had my order wrong, but was told that she heard me say strawberry. Aside from the fact that mango and strawberry sounds nothing alike, she rudely insisted that I told her strawberry. I also did not appreciate the dirty attitude I was getting from her when I was trying to talk to her politely...

So after a while, it seems that my order was going to be fixed. But after waiting some more, I only received 1 mango and was given 1 strawberry despite telling her I ordered 2 mango, not 1 mango and 1 strawberry.

Anyways, we had planned on heading to Union Grill, but its still under construction :( I asked my friend how lulu's was & she gave a long, confused ""It's ok"" & a weird look. Since 3 outta the 4 of us hadn't been here, we decided to try.

There was no wait to be seated but a good 10-15 minutes until our server came.. which was weird since she also seated us. The menu looked like basic pork, chicken beef or duck dishes served over rice or noodles. We all ordered the teriyaki chicken rice bowl (weird, huh?) It didn't take long for it to come out but it was just weird how hot the rice & bowl were compared to chicken. Do they stick the bowl in the oven/microwave once ordered?

After the cook or whatever served our food, no one checked if we needed anything. My cup was empty forever before she finally came over& by that time she asked if we were ready for check. I guess you're supposed to take your bill/money to the register & we didn't know that. We just left everything on the table after waiting forever for her to head back. If you're not serving the food, refilling drinks or taking the bill what is the point of having servers?! Also was disappointing to hear them turn away customers at 9:40 because the kitchen was closed.. not 945 or 950. 940

Overall food was crappy. My friend didn't eat half of his because the chicken resembled pork & the floor was so dirty as if they only sweep at closing time. No thaaaanks ill make my own chicken & rice at home.

The service at Lulu's seems extremely disorganized. Waits in excess of 45 minutes for noodles are not on heard of. They constantly look unsure of who is to be served next and which of the staff should be responsible for what. 

The food is high end dorm food. It's not unpalatable but the Chinese/Japanese/South Asian winds up just muddling all the flavors rather than creating anything authentic. 

You're much better off paying a little bit more at the higher end restaurants on Craig for significantly higher quality food.  Alternatively you could pay significantly less at one of the many chains-restaurants and get food of equal quality. 

Avoid this place.","2014-02-01",1

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","I detest this place. It used to be amazing! Brings back fond memories of coming here with my mom. I don't know what happened in the 11 years since I last ate here but it's gone downhill. 

The first part is a  review of the take out we ordered. 

Pad Thai was wayy too sweet and oily. 

Soups had a thick layer of oil. 

Curry was bland and flavorless. We ordered this takeout once and they put the rice under the curry. I've never had curry take out that served it this way. It's usually separate. 

My mom never throws food out. This was a first for me to see her throw out three entrees right away. 

Came here after an exam to meet with friends. Deciding to give it one more shot. The chicken with veggie dish I ordered was actually ok. What made me mad was when I ordered hot water NOT TEA the woman behind the counter brought me tea with my meal. I politely told her oh I actually just wanted hot water she sternly said they don't offer  just hot water and made no attempt to take tea away. (It was already brewed in the cup when she brought it.)  we just looked at each other for a minute.  I took the tea and vowed  in my head  that due to the customer service and bad food I would never set foot in this establishment again.","2014-02-05",1

The negatives:  Food was only OK.  The Sczehwan chicken was really tasty but the other three dishes were pretty bland.

We ate here after a visit to the Carnegie museums on a cold January Sunday.  Where we were seated in the dining room, we got a blast of icy air every time someone came in or out. Not sure if they could do anything to improve that situation but it certainly made our visit less enjoyable.  

If you are looking for a quick affordable meal, this is a great place.  However, I think in their quest to offer a lot of variety they lost some of their quality.","2014-02-10",3

By using these metrics, I usually have had a good experience here (I've been maybe 3 or 4 times). Typically, I never am hungry enough to get a ""Big Eat"" from the menu, I just stick with one of the ""Small"" vegetarian meals and it suits me well. The last few times I've gotten the steamed vegetables with tufu, and a $4.25 a bowl you can't have many complaints. It's been a nice place to walk over to from work, and it's great that it's open until almost 10pm to serve the college crowds from Pitt and CMU. And definitely try one of the bubble smoothies at some point- they were all the rage when they came out a few years ago and are actually quite tasty (if overpriced).","2014-02-14",3

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","If you're looking for any semblance of ""authentic Asian food"" then turn around and run the other way. Never have I been so disappointed by an Asian restaurant-- seriously, even Oriental Express is more authentic than the shit they serve here. Every single time I ordered a noodle dish, I've been shown a new way in which that food could be horribly disgraced. Overpriced, overrated, and I absolutely abhor the decor. 

The decor is obscenely cheesy-- why do I want to look at stock photo images of people touching my noodles in ways that violate all kinds of health codes? It just makes me wonder what passes as ""sanitary"" in their kitchen. 

Pad Thai: a sad pile of overcooked rice noodles with a wretched, bland peanut sauce that lethargically oozes like Jabba the Hut. Pathetic doesn't even begin to describe it. I could smear peanut butter on dried ramen noodles for a better experience.

Pho: well how could you really expect this place to create a beef consomme-esque broth with authentic viet flavors? Awful. I can't even.

My review may be slightly inaccurate because I haven't been there since people lied to my stupid freshman dorm about how great this place is, but if it hasn't changed since then RUN AWAY. GO TO ROSE TEA. OR ANYWHERE ELSE. SUBWAY. QUIZNOS. SAVE YOURSELF MONEY AND BOWEL TROUBLES.","2014-05-07",1

It's a far cry for authentic Asian food, and, having traveled several times to East Asia, I know what that is.  I also ordered the bubble tea, which was decent--however, there's now another place half a block down where you can get that for take-out or eat-in.  Based on the quality of the food, I'm surprised that this place is always packed.  Then again, I suppose it appeals mainly to the college student crowd, many of whom care about inexpensiveness over food quality.  If you're on S.

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","To the reviewer who complained they were never served at lunch: This must have been due to a major miscommunication / misunderstanding. Lunch does not include table service. You place your order at the cashier, get a number, then they bring the food out when it is ready. I'm surprised you were 'seated by a host', and I'm surprised someone after you was 'served immediately'. This almost sounds like you are reviewing a different restaurant! Or at the least, mistook someone's cafeteria tray with beverages and fortune cookies (served immediately by the cashier) for having been served. Any way, better luck next time. 
It is problematic that newcomers are not informed of the lunch policy. There seems to be no one working as 'host' during lunch. It is also problematic that the menu is disorganized; grouped by size ""small eats"" ""big eats"" ""noodle bowls"" ""rice dishes"". Soups are all over the place, depending on whether you order a meal sized or appetizer sized soup. This would be ok during dinner when there is table service, but instead you have to rapidly scan the menu while waiting in line at the cashier.
On the bright side: there seems to be no obligation to tip during lunch!","2014-06-24",2

This was our go-to after-school spot in high school post-Model UN practice (here I am revealing that I'm a huge nerd) when we didn't feel like risking the dietary aftermath than can happen at the O. The crab rangoons are fabulous--a crispy crust with boiling-hot cream cheese in the middle that is just sweet enough. I also like the cold sesame noodles, the big bowl of wonton noodle soup, the stir-fried beef noodles, and the fried tofu. Their most popular seller is apparently the General Tso's chicken, but it's too sweet for me. I also tried the Dr. Fu's special noodles (a mystery dish with no item description, but my dad works with the eponymous Dr. Fu so I felt a need to try them) and it was essentially stir-fried egg noodles with chicken, bean sprout, and hoisin. Decent, but too greasy for me. Sorry Dr. Fu!

- Crab Rangoon
- Beef Chow Fun
- Singapore Rice Noodles
- Spicy Basil Noodles
- Lulu's Pan Fried Noodles

This also used to be my go-to bubble tea place (before Rose Tea Cafe) and that was good too. Not the best - but good.

And the service is typically super fast.

I've been coming here with my significant other for six or seven years now, mostly because we had our first date here and it's convenient to a lot of places we go. We're married now, and still come back, but only occasionally.

It seriously hasn't changed at all from the first time we went, except that they just recently raised prices a little bit. (Which is OK. Inflation happens.)

My favorite eats: Chicken Noodle Bowl, Singapore Rice Noodles, Hot and Sour Soup.

I don't recommend the pho. I've had it twice, and it's watery and very bland.

His favorite eats: Singapore Rice Noodles, Beef Chow Fun, Pad Thai.

Also keep in mind that this place is in the heart of a college neighborhood, nestled between Pitt and CMU, so there's going to a lot of college kids eating there. For the most part, I'm indifferent about that.

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","My wife and I went to Lulu's for lunch after visiting the Carnegie Art Museum, having found Lulu's on Garmin's Mapsource for my GPS as a restaurant within easy walking distance of the museum.  After reading some Yelp reviews, and comparing Lulu's with some other restaurants, we decided it was as good as any others and seemingly better than some in the area (Ali Baba, our first choice, isn't open on Saturdays).  I got Singapore Noodles, and my wife the Beef and noodles dish.  The service was fast, the food delicious (though mine was a bit light on the curry sauce and, upon mentioning this to our delightful waitress resulted in the dish being taken back to the chef, with the result of a nice amount of additional sauce added--they keep it light for American tastes, but I like it a bit heartier, and that's what I got after mentioning it).  The veggies in the Singapore noodles were done just right--crisp and tasty, with lots of chicken and shrimp, and other requisite goodies for that dish.  My wife said she really liked the Beef noodle dish, and gave me a taste--it was indeed yummy.  Next time we're downtown near Lulu's for lunch I think I'll try that one.  The place is bright and airy, with lovely modern surroundings, great wait staff, and clearly good food, and interestingly, not at all expensive for what you receive!  Great restaurant!  ...Next time too, I think I saw on the menu one of my old favorite Korean dishes: BiBimBop.  I suspect that'll be worth a try also.","2014-10-12",4

I'm glad that they finally changed their bubble tea menu that now allows you to choose options such as the kind of tea, different boba and juices that are available. You can even choose how much or little sweetener that you want in your tea. The food is sub-par. I have found that Dr. Fu's noodles are my go to dish even though the past two times I've ordered there were only five small pieces of chicken throughout the entire dish. So, go and try it but proceed with caution knowing that there are far better options out there for you.","2014-11-07",2

I recently I went there and ordered the Szechuan Chicken Noodle Bowl. The dish is supposed to be spicy, when it arrived and the sauce was red. It looked spicy, but as soon as I tasted it, I realized it was extremely sweet. The sauce was so sweet, that I was unable to eat it. Once the sauce started to cool down, the sauce started to thicken like candy.","2014-11-08",2

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","I've been going here since late 90'-early 00's. THey have DOWNGRADED CONSIDERABLY. 

Yes, I have experienced better...especially at Lu Lu's not too long ago actually. Five years ago...I would have given them 4 stars (out a star for rude register attendants which has not changed).

They use to have delicious Thai Ice tea...tragically discontinued. They use to offer a sauce with their crab rangoon...no more. They changed the milk from the bubble milk teas which curdles if you order certain flavors (mango). They changed the fine rice noodles in the wonton noodle soup to egg noodles, all while the prices soared. 

They probably pay no mind of the loss of my and my family's long standing patronage, because most of their patrons are huge influx of students and people who come and go and are use to their average local american-asian fast food establishments, have no clue that all asian restaurants on and near south Craig is delicious, and have no clue on how superior Lu Lu's use to be even to their local rivals which now they stand beneath because they eliminated all of the best things they once offered  their consumers.

Two stars remain due to their late hours and their portions remain generous (for now). There is a chance I would go there again for they remain about a step above the average low-end asian-american restaurants, but chances are...If I am in Oakland, I'm going to head to one of the other asian restaurants for they are ALL superior to the average asian fast food restaurants.","2014-11-09",2

The spring rolls are perfectly crisp with a delicious sauce that I have yet to find anywhere else (although I would like to take a bottle home with me). The service is similar to that of Hello Bistro (you order, pay and they bring it to you), so don't expect great service or anything. 

Lulu's is a strange combination of every cuisine in Southeast Asia, but hey, it's flavorful and plenty. I love the Hawaiian fried rice and if I'm really hungry, I'll splurge and get a mango smoothie because their smoothies are the best in the area.","2015-01-12",5

I usually don't go out of my way to come and eat here. I've had vegetable dishes here and they're okay. The bubble tea is overwhelmingly sweet, like it was drenched in sugar. The scallion pancakes tasted and looked like tortillas sprinkled in salt and scallions. They weren't chewy and thick like they should be. 

Lulu's is tackling too many different kinds of cuisines so that everything turns out to be just ok. I feel If they focused on fewer dishes it could be great.","2015-02-07",2

But like I said, the food was better than your average Chinese food restaurant.  The moo shoo pork came with a BBQ soy sauce that was pleasantly surprising and something I've never gotten with moo shoo before.  The egg rolls were larger than I expected and the wonton soup was very tasty; seasoned well and better than just broth and wontons.

Would definitely recommend Lulu's but it's a little out of the way for Pitt students, especially in the winter and if you're going for delivery it can get a bit pricey.","2015-02-15",4

My dad ordered the special. The food was lukewarm; it was unlikely it was made to order. I ordered Thai Lemon Beef on noodles. As soon as I saw it, my appetite disappeared. It was a plate of noodles drowned in goop. Although the noodles, beef, and vegetables tasted okay, I had a very difficult time trying to remove as much sauce as possible. My dad finished my plate for me; I couldn't bring myself to eat the last few noodles that were positively swimming in the sauce.","2015-03-08",1

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","I've worked in Oakland for nearly 15 years and I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal at LuLu's.  While the experience and ambiance isn't always perfect, the food typically is.

In regards to the experience - it gets very busy at lunchtime, and rightfully so.  However, the line snakes through the restaurant and around the tables so it is often a chaotic dining experience.  They finally fixed the issue with the strong currents of cold (or warm, depending on the season) air that you used to burst in every time someone opened the door.  

I almost always pick the spicy Szechuan noodles with tofu - these thin noodles are complimented with a tangy (and not really spicy) sauce with veggies and your choice of protein.  Other favorites are the Pad Thai and the Hawaii's fried rice.  My absolute favorite appetizer is the crab rangoon.  Fantastic!

Lulu's has relaxed a little with their policy of 'cash only at lunchtime' but I think they do still prefer cold hard cash but will take your debit card if you smile and say thanks.  

They also have a nice variety of bubble teas if that's your thing.","2015-03-12",4

I wasn't aware of the fact that you need to get money from the ATM if you plan on buying a meal using your credit card for under $10.00.  I should have checked the insider tips beforehand.  I had to wait in a longer line, but eventually I got my food.  I was looking for a dish with more vegetables, but the lady at the register told me that the Pad Tai and Chicken Curry dish had an equal amount of vegetables.  It would have been an extra $2.00 to get an additional vegetables, so I thought I would pass.  I ended up getting the Chicken Pad Tai, which I thought overall it was decent, but I've eaten better Pad Tai at a different restaurant.  If I come back here, I'm going to be prepared with cash on hand and will be looking for a chicken dish with more vegetables.","2015-03-26",2

Onto the star of the show ... the bubble tea!  I'm soooooo excited to see popping boba as an option!  It's the only bubble tea joint I've found here that offers this treat!

Lulu's has a very Americanized interior and, you can eat-in or go to the to-go counter.  It was eighty degrees out, and I wanted a mango slush with bubbles!  I had previously seen that Lulu's sold them, so Sophia H. and I stopped in.  I was hoping this would be like Mango Mango in Chinatown in NYC with real mango, but it was not.

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","LuLu's used to be my favorite eatery in Oakland. But all good things must come to an end, and even I have to admit that LuLu's reign on Craig Street is over.

I visited LuLu's for the first time in three years this weekend with a friend, and was not impressed. For starters, no one came to our table to even ask about drinks for nearly 10 minutes after we were seated. This was on a Sunday night, in the summer (i.e. when Oakland's main residents are gone), when the place was half empty. It was a bad start for the night, for the sure.

To the kitchen's credit, the food we ordered did come out very quickly - I think we waited about 10 minutes for it. But it was tasteless compared to what it used to be. Or rather, mine was; my friend had no complaints about her chicken and rice dish. My BBQ pork soup, however, was really not good. The pork slices (the few that I got anyway) were the tastiest part of the meal. The broth was forgettable, though, and the noodles were so bland that I swore at times that my water had more flavor than my meal.

In addition to the meal putting my taste buds to sleep, the waitress continued to fail to impress me throughout the evening. For one thing, not only did she not take our drink orders promptly: she failed to bring a water that my friend ordered. She also did not check on us very regularly throughout the meal, which left us sitting and waiting for refills often. And after leaving us alone at our table for most of the night she screwed up our bills as well, and double charged one of us for both of our meals. We got it fixed, but after everything else that night we were not pleased.

I wish I could say that this experience was a fluke, but based on other reviews, this is the new norm. Sorry, LuLu's, but this is not a norm that I'm going to settle for - not when there's other cheap eats in the city!","2015-06-29",2

After other patrons became aware of the situation and started to get up, a cook or busboy came out with a broom and proceeded to bludgeon the creature to death just steps away from us.  The waitress ""explained"" to us that there were sticky traps and other devices in the kitchen and back of the house, but they didn't want customers to see any dead rodents or traps in the dining area because it ""wouldn't look good""!  I guess having rodents run around the dining area and having sweaty kitchen help come out and club it to death in the middle of the dining area is perfectly acceptable and normal as far as LuLu's is concerned.  

As I tried to get up in horror, not eating my meal, the waitress thought it was appropriate to bring me a bill.  Another male staff member came over and reiterated that this was ""normal"" and as long as they have traps in the kitchen ""the health department doesn't care"".  

I loath to see what the extent of the infestation is in regards to the kitchen and food storage areas.  I guess if it's ""normal"" to have rodents running around your customer's feet in a dining area as they eat Singapore Rice Noodles (more like mice noodles), it's probably regarded as ""normal"" to have rodents eating and defecating on foodstuffs in the back of the house.  Think about that before you order from here next time.

I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN THIS PLACE AGAIN!","2015-08-25",1

Tom yum soup just broth, with four or five floating mushroom slices.  Haven't been here for quite awhile. Shocked by horribleness.  Wont be back.","2015-09-24",1

We will definitely return soon! 

Good going Lu Lu's!!!","2015-10-07",4

The produce was very fresh and each type of veggie was incredibly well-cooked. I was truly impressed and made sure to tell them so. The crab rangoon was flavorful and balanced the sweet cheese with the flavor of the crab very well. The egg rools were crisp and not oily, also made with a nice mix of fresh veggies. 

The attention to detail was impressive and refreshing, as it always is. As a vegetarian, I always appreciate the variety and quality of the produce that the kitchen uses. 

It is always a treat to visit Lulu's and is a pilgrimage I find myself making time and again. Fifteen years and I'm still a happy customer!","2015-11-11",5

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","I have mix review about Lulu. The best thing about lulu was their service and their decor (not many Asian restaurent looks good). Food is okay but it is their service that always pulled me, however today we got extremely disappointed (me, my wife and my friend we 3 went there). First my wife she ordered Korean bibimap with chicken but she got duck. That's no big deal so we didn't complain
the disappointment was when a waitress got the bill while we were still eating and she waited right in front of me it was awkward so I pulled my credit card and gave her. She then left and came back in 2 min and while my friend was still eating (he was literally putting his spoon on his mouth ) the waitress said  ""when are you going to pay"". That was really rude. I told her he will pay once he is done. It's not that we were there for long we took hardly 15 or 20 min to eat there and it was not even a closing hours.

I eat out regularly and i always pay about 20 percent tips but this time I didn't tip. The funny part was that the cashier came to collect the cash from my friend and the cashier said u should tip to the server.... lol... I politely told him what made me tip her zero he gracefully accepted and gave me the number to complain.

To all the people who work in Lulu place. U guys are awsum. I love how friendly u guys are. Your service is great it is just one individual server. I will not stop going to lulu place but If I ever get the same server I will request for another server.","2015-11-15",3

Pittsburgh, PA 15213","This was one of the first restaurants I tried in Pittsburgh. The hubs and I went here after a jaunt at the Natural History museum. This place has noodles and it caught my eye. 

I honestly don't remember if it was cash only. I think I paid with credit card but they might have had a limit to the amount. For a meal, I'll hit it--no problem. For a bubble tea or something quick, I might not come here since it'll be cash only. 
Food here was great! Service was peppy and the selections are awesome. I had my longtime favorite, yuntunmian and the broth was served on the side, which was novel. Hubby ordered the creamy Thai tea and crunchy egg noodles and we left full and happy. Portions are generous and prices are good! Presentation was nice and seating wasn't cramped or anything. 
Students always get the best small eateries close by. Lucky!","2015-11-19",4

Every thing taste fresh and cooked to order!  The decor hasn't changed in the years I've been coming here. It's usually always busy when we come, but this Saturday afternoon it was pretty dead!  

Service is quick and on point! 

Great place to go for a quick bite that is delicious","2015-11-21",4

The last time I was there we waited a good thirty minutes for food and they didn't make my friend's order right. They also messed up the checks big time and added things that shouldn't have been on there. I still think the food is great so I hope to see improved service the next time I go.","2015-12-09",3

My wife and I arrived at 5:45 on a Friday night; we had tickets to see John Waters at the Carnegie hall across the street at 8:00.  Simple? NO!  We placed our orders; two noodle bowls and Pot Stickers.  Over a half hour later we asked the server where our food was, we noticed our order was still on her pad!  She lied and said ""soon"".  Twenty minutes later our Pot Stickers were placed on someone else's table.  We had to argue with the runner to get them on our table.  (BTW, they were TERRIBLE).  Still no food by 7:30.  We had to leave or miss the event.    So I go to the cashier; ""I will pay for the Pot Sticker but we must leave"".  I WAS HANDED A CHECK FOR THE ENTIRE MEAL!  I ask for the Manager.  I was ignored.  I start yelling.  I'm still ignored for ten minutes.  So we left. The John Waters event was ruined because we were so hungry.  ONE HOUR AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTES!!  The entire staff at Lulu's should be ASHAMED! I am owed an apology.","2015-12-17",1
